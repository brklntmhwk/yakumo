** Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: overview
:END:

This repository is my home in the digital world weaved from dotfiles.

*** Principles
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: principles
:END:
- *Less is more:* Keep dependencies to a minimum and reduce attack surface.
  - Not using such popular tools as Home Manager or Flake-parts.
- *Low-maintenance:* Easy to maintain. You know where to tweak at a glance. (Maybe...)
  - Sticking to the Dependency Inversion principle as much as possible to make updates a breeze.
- *Cool:* After all, what drives us to tend our dotfiles is pure self-satisfaction, isn't it?

Yakumo stands on the shoulders of great pioneers from all walks of life. Heartfelt thanks to all the developers involved in the Nix community, Nixpkgs development, and beyond.

Especially, these projects brought Yakumo a large portion of inspiration in the following aspects:

- *The module options:* [[https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager][Home Manager]]
- *The custom modules system:* [[https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles][Hlissner's Dotfiles]]
- *The wrapper approach:* [[https://github.com/viperML/dotfiles][ViperML's Dotfiles]]
- *The theming approach and the fewer with keywords as possible policy:* [[https://github.com/sioodmy/dotfiles][Sioodmy's Dotfiles]]
- *The overall service management:* [[https://github.com/oddlama/nix-config][Oddlama's Nix-config]]
